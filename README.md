# Citizen Browser newsletter data
Data repository for standalone editions of the [Citizen Browser newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/citizenbrowser).

Citizen Browser construction and methodology is described in "[How We Built a Facebook Inspector](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/how-we-built-a-facebook-inspector)."

Data is organized in directories labelled with the release date of the newsletter. A markdown file inside each directory gives a brief description of the data within it.
